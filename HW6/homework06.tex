This assignment may be completed with one partner.  You and your
partner should submit a single solution on CMS. Please do not offer or
accept any other assistance on this assignment. Late submissions will
not be accepted.

\begin{exercise}
Recall the syntax of the untyped $\lambda$-calculus. 
\[
\begin{array}{rcl}
e & ::= & x \mid \lam{x}{e} \mid e_1~e_2\\
v & ::= & \lam{x}{e}
\end{array}
\]
Define a large-step semantics for this language under call-by-name
(lazy) evaluation.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
In this exercise you will develop encodings in call-by-value untyped
$\lambda$-calculus.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Define an expression $\nm{EQUAL}$ that tests whether two Church numerals 
  are equal, and returns the corresponding Church boolean.
\item Define expressions for each of the
  following list constructs: $\nm{NIL}$, $\nm{CONS}$, $\nm{HD}$,
  $\nm{TL}$, and $\nm{IS\_NIL}$. To keep things simple, applying
  either $\nm{HD}$ or $\nm{TL}$ to $\nm{NIL}$ should produce
  $\nm{NIL}$. Also, if you find it helpful, you may use the encodings
  of booleans and pairs discussed in class.
\item Define a function $\nm{SUM}$ that adds up an encoded list of encoded Church
  numerals.
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
The simply-typed $\lambda$-calculus is not Turing complete---as shown
in lecture, every well-typed expression reduces to a value. It is not
hard to recover Turing completeness by adding an explicit fixpoint
operator to the language. We first extend the syntax of the language
with a new construct,
\[
e ::= \dots \mid \typ{fix}~e\\
\]
and then add evaluation contexts and a small-step semantics rule to
handle it:
\begin{center}
$E ::= \dots \mid \typ{fix}~E$

\infrule{}{\typ{fix}~(\lam{x\ty\tau}{e}) \stepsone e\{\typ{fix}~(\lam{x\ty\tau}{e}) / x\}}{} 
\end{center}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Give the typing rule for fixpoints.
\item Give the case of the progress lemma for fixpoints, assuming the proof is by induction on typing derivations.
\item Give the case of the preservation lemma for fixpoints, assuming the proof is done by induction on evaluation rules.
\end{enumerate}

\end{exercise}
