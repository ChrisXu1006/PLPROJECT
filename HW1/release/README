This directory contains the LaTeX sources for CS 4110 homeworks.

STRUCTURE

The tex/ directory contains LaTeX support files. Many of the macros
used to typeset assignments are defined in jnf.sty, local.sty, etc.
All other dependencies should be provided by your TeX installation. If
you are having trouble with a particular dependency, I suggest
installing it manually (hard) or using TeXLive or MacTeX (easy).

The pdf/ directory contains PDF graphics 

The homework/ directory contains the LaTeX source for the homework
itself.

BUILDING

To build the homework, 

  $ cd homework
  $ pdflatex homework01

This should create a file homework01.pdf
